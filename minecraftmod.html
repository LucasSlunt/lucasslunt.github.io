<h1>Arkus's Fishing</h1>
<h3>An unfinished mod for minecraft java edition, version 1.19</h3>
<body>
<p>
Fishing in minecraft has missed potential. There are only 4 varieties of fish you can catch, and all of them can be caught anywhere. Fishing is unaffected by time, weather, biome, or dimension. The only exception is bamboo, which can be fished up in the jungle. This outlier gave me the idea to make a mod where the player could catch different fish depending on which biome they're in. After all, since the game already had code to determine fishing loot based on biome, how hard could it be to reuse that code for something interesting?
</p>
<p>
When adding new fish, I wanted a few basic ones to make each biome interesting. I wanted to to make fishing exciting, and encourage players to seek out every fish variety, or at least to try fishing when they entered a new environment. I did this by creating many fish with unique effects, requirements to catch them, or that could be used to craft unique items. To keep the games progression system balanced, everything you can get from fishing fits in with the early to mid game progression.

<h2>How the fishing system works</h2>
<h3>The vanilla fishing system</h3>
<body><p>
In vanilla minecraft, fishing is calculated through loot tables in JSON files. When a player casts their fishing rod, the game runs the main fishing loot table, randomly selecting the 'fish', 'junk', or 'treasure' loot table. Each element in a loot table has a weight associated with it, the chance that that element gets selected. the 'fish' loot table has an 85% chance of being selected, 'junk' has a 10% chance, and 'treasure' has a 5% chance. If the players fishing rod is enchanted with the Luck of the Sea enchantment, the weight for the 'treasure' loot table is increased, and the weight for the 'junk' loot table is decreased. There are several checks that can be preformed before an element in a loot table is selected, such as the biome the player is in, the weather, dimension, and even how many in-game days have passed.
</p></body>
<h3>How I modified the fishing system</h3>
<body><p>
Editing the main fishing loot table, I kept the 'junk' and 'treasure' loot tables, but replaced the more general 'fish' loot table with a new table, which I called I called "fishing_biome'. This table condensed the list of nearly 60 biomes in minecraft into 11 biome sub catagories. Each of these 11 biome catagories has its own loot table, filled with different fish that seem appropriate for that biome type. When selected by the main fishing loot table, the fishing biome table would see which biome the player was in, and return the loot table corresponding to it. Some biomes fit into multiple catagories, such as the frozen ocean biome, which I catagorized as both 'ocean' and 'cold'. In cases like these, the fishing biome table randomly selected which of the possible loot tables to use.\nIn addion to biome, some fish require certain weather or time conditions to be caught. This was done by including these conditions inside of the specific biome loot tables I used the weighting system from earlier to make some fish more rare than others, for example, trout are quite common in the biomes they appear in, but moonfish and sturgeon are quite difficult to catch.\nI wanted to include something in both the junk and the treasure tables, as fish that could be caught anywhere, with the chance of catching them affected by Luck of the Sea. Goldfish appear in the treasure table, because gold is quite valuable. Swordfish appear in the junk table, because they are most useful for early and midgame players, without access to higher tiers of swords. Endgame players are likely to find swordfish useless, and as swordfish are tools, they are unstackable and could clog up players inventory. By having them in the junk table, endgame players with Luck of the Sea are less likely to fish them up and become frusterated with fishing.

<h2>What I would do differently</h2>
<body>
<p>
I currently have no plans to continue this project, or restart it. If I were to begin this again however, there are a few things I would change. The current system of calling loot tables based on a hand crafted list of biome catagories is tedious, and could lead to confusion if a player doesn't know which biomes are associated with each loot table. It also isn't compatible with with other mods. Instead, I would have loot tables based on minecrafts biome tempurature system, and a few loot tables for specific biomes like mushroom islands. I would also like to implement more fish with unique conditions for catching them, such as player height or moon phase.
