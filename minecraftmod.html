<h1>Arkus's Fishing</h1>
<h3>An unfinished mod for minecraft java edition, version 1.19</h3>
<body>
<p>
Fishing in minecraft has missed potential. There are only 4 varieties of fish you can catch, and all of them can be caught anywhere. Fishing is unaffected by time, weather, biome, and dimension. The only exception is bamboo, which can be fished up in the jungle. This outlier gave me the idea to make a mod where the player could catch different fish depending on which biome they're in. After all, since the game already had code to determine fishing loot based on biome, how hard could it be to reuse that code for something interesting?
</p>
<p>
When adding new fish, I wanted a few basic ones to make each biome interesting. I wanted to to make fishing exciting, and encourage players to seek out every fish variety, or at least to try fishing when they entered a new environment. I did this by creating many fish with unique effects, requirements to catch them, or that could be used to craft unique items. To keep the games progression system balanced, everything you can get from fishing fits in with the early to mid game progression.
