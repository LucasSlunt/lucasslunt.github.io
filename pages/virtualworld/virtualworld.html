        In this project, I have used Unity, Gaia, and Blender to create a virtual world
         around the theme of mountains and berry-picking.
        One of my goals for the project was to emulate a small part of the water system, where 
         large rivers are formed by smaller streams in the mountains. I'm particularily proud
          of the fog, it almost feels refreshing to walk through.
          <br><br>
         Although Gaia provided many different types of foliage for the world, I wanted to 
         create some of my own. I added patches of strawberries as
         I enjoy picking them in the wild, and 
         strawberries seemed like a fun plant to model. Along with the foliage , I 
         added bridges, fences, crates, baskets, and various other pieces of interest to 
         create a world that's interesting and cohesive.

        Gaia is a unity asset that aides in the creation of large terrains like this. 
        With Gaia I was able to quickly generate a terrain based off a heightmap of a 
        mountain range, and paint it with the appropriate textures. The asset comes with 
        a game object spawer system, to place objects like trees, rocks, flowers, etc. 
        in the appropriate places. It also includes a first person character controller 
        like the one featured in the video showcase. Overall Gaia is a great tool for 
        worldbuilding and it allowed me to quickly create a basic foundation for the 
        world I have now.
